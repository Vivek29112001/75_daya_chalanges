The function should return a new array of objects, where each object contains the playlist name and the total duration of all songs in that playlist (in seconds).
## Question 32:
You have two objects. The first object represents a user's profile with properties like name, email, and an array of social media links (each link having a platform and a URL).

## Question 34:
Write a function that takes an array of objects, each with an id, name, and a managerId (representing the id of their manager). The function should return a nested object representing the organizational hierarchy, where each manager's id is a key, and the value is an object containing their name and an array of their direct reports (as nested objects).
## Question 35:
You have an array of objects, where each object represents a student with a name and a grades object (where keys are subject names and values are grades). Write a function that calculates the GPA for each student and returns a new array of objects, where each object has the student's name and their GPA.
## Question 36:

## Question 37:
You have an object representing a configuration, where keys are setting names and values are either simple values or nested configuration objects. Write a function that flattens this configuration object into a single-level object, where keys are dot-separated paths (e.g., "database.host", "database.port").
## Question 38:
Given two arrays of objects, where each object has an id and a set of tags (represented as an array of strings), write a function that finds the intersection of tags between the two arrays and returns a new array of objects containing only the objects that share at least one tag, along with the common tags.
## Question 39:
Write a function that takes an array of strings representing log entries. Each log entry contains a timestamp, event type, and a JSON string with event details. The function should parse the JSON string, group the logs by event type, and return an object where keys are event types and values are arrays of parsed event details objects.
## Question 40:
You have an array of objects, where each object represents a project with an id, name, and an array of member objects (each member having a userId and role). Write a function that transforms this array into an object where keys are project ids and values are objects containing the project name and an object where keys are user roles and values are arrays of userIds in that role for that project.
